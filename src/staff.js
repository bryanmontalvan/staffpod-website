                    <h2>Jaelyn Dones</h2>
                    <p><b>Description:</b><br />I'm Jaelyn (also known as Jaelyn the great) and this will be my second year at UML, however, in terms of academics, I have junior status from taking summer classes and AP classes in high school. This is my first summer being a staff member of SoarCS and I am a SoarCS alum from 2020. As a part of Engaging Computing Group, this summer I was onboarded with the MYR development team and will be contributing to (and debugging) the MYR technology we used in our first week of SoarCS. I co-run a 3D printing business so in my free time, I am either picking out filament, packing up orders, or procrastinating by playing CS:GO. I am also an assistant tech supervisor at my local staples so I'm pretty good with computer hardware and software. </p>

                    <p><b>Description:</b><br />I'm Danielle, and I'll be a sophomore this semester. It's my first year as a SoarCS staff member, and I'm a fellow SoarCS 2020 alum with Bryan and Jaelyn. My favorite personal project is an (unfinished) recreation of Boom Blox in virtual reality. I also enjoy making apps in Android Studio, and I hope to publish something one day, be it a game or a productivity app. In my spare time, I am most likely knitting while watching anime and/or listening to music.</p>

                    <p><b>Description:</b><br/>Hi, my name is Justin. I'm a rising senior at UML. This is my third year being part of a SoarCS. Also, I'm a research assistant at the Engaging Computing Group, responsible for the development of MYR. In my spare time, I like to listen to music, play games, and do programming! Right now, I'm into graphical programming with C++ and OpenGLðŸ“º</p>

                    <h2>Zach McCann</h2>
                    <p><b>Description:</b><br />Iâ€™m Zach, and Iâ€™m going into my third year at UML. This is my second year on SoarCS staff, as well as in Fredâ€™s lab ECG (Engaging Computing Group). In addition to SoarCS, another ECG project I am heavily involved with is the Groundwater Analysis project, a collaboration between ECG and Professor James Heiss of the Environmental Science department. This is also my second year working on that project. I have a passion to see practical real-world applications for mathematics and computing, so working with ECG is a dream come true! In my free time, I love to go hiking, backpacking, and camping. Iâ€™ve hiked the entire MA section of the Appalachian Trail, as well as 90 miles of the VT section. Iâ€™d love to thru-hike the AT one day!</p>
